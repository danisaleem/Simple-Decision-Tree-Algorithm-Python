# Simple-Decision-Tree-Algorithm-Python
A simple python script that implements Decision Tree Algorithm and classify on a very small test data set

# Why Decision trees?
We have couple of other algorithms there, so why do we have to choose Decision trees??
well, there might be many reasons but I believe a few which are
- Decision tress often mimic the human level thinking so its so simple to understand the data and make some good interpretations.
- Decision trees actually make you see the logic for the data to interpret.

# So what is the decision tree??
A decision tree is a tree where each node represents a feature(attribute), each link(branch) represents a decision(rule) and each leaf represents an outcome(categorical or continues value).
The whole idea is to create a tree like this for the entire data and process a single outcome at every leaf(or minimize the error in every leaf).

# Pre-requisites

## Anaconda Python & Jupyter Notebook

One must have Python installed in his local system. Use jupyter notebook to run this script.
